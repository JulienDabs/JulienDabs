# {{ Hello.World!! }}
## Who am I?
I'm Julien a Junior Web Developper. 6 months ago I didn't have a clue on what the Web Developpement is or what it does. Now it feels like a million years ago! 
I'm currently being trained at [Ecole O'Clock](https://oclock.io/). In the first 3 months of the 6 months program we had a very intense training on the following languages: 
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - PHP
  - JS
  - MySQL

A well as how to understand the whole process, work in Pair Programming, understanding AGILE method and much more.
## And now what?
As part of the traning we've been asked to choose a framework to specialized. And I chose Symfony as I particulary loved work with PHP and the Backend. As the last step of the training we (a team of 4 to 5 Web Developper) are required to create a project from A to Z. 

The project will be about a fictive Tennis Club. We will have to create a web who allow to make reservation of a court, create new accounts and interact with an API.
